# Code for computing Security Violations using Correlation Graphs

The code has 2 main parts:
1. Pipeline to perform all the steps (anomaly detection, and then isolation) using scripts
2. Code to generate data from the application model (TEP)

There are additional Jupyter notebooks that describe particular runs of pre-defined data

# Usage

The folder "Website Demonstration Code" contains examples that can be run. It is the simplest place to start.
